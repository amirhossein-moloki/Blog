*   **Team Management:** Create and manage teams, add or remove members.
*   **Wallet System:** Manage user wallets, including deposits, withdrawals, entry fees, and prize money.
*   **Chat System:** Real-time chat between users.
*   **Notification System:** Real-time notifications for users.
*   **API Documentation:** Automatically generated API documentation using `drf-spectacular`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   PostgreSQL 12+
*   Redis

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tournament-project.git
    cd tournament-project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up the environment variables:**

    Copy the example environment file and fill in your details.

    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    You must set the `SECRET_KEY` and `DATABASE_URL` for your local PostgreSQL instance. The other variables have sensible defaults for local development.

    **Example `.env`:**
    ```
    SECRET_KEY="your-super-secret-key-here"
    DEBUG=True
    DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/tournament_db"
    REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379/0"
    ```

5.  **Run the database migrations:**

    ```bash
    python tournament_project/manage.py migrate
    ```

6.  **Create a superuser:**

    ```bash
    python tournament_project/manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

7.  **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    python tournament_project/manage.py runserver
    ```

The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/`.

### API Documentation

The API documentation is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/`.

## Running with Docker

This project is configured to run with Docker and Docker Compose. This is the recommended way to run the project for development.

### Prerequisites

*   Docker
*   Docker Compose

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tournament-project.git
    cd tournament-project
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment variables:**

    The project uses a `.env` file for environment variables. You can copy the example file:

    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    The default values in `.env` are configured to work with the Docker Compose setup. You may want to change the `SECRET_KEY` to a new, randomly generated value.

3.  **Build and run the application:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will build the Docker images and start all the services. The application will be available at `http://localhost:80`.

4.  **Create a superuser (optional):**

    To create a superuser, run the following command in a separate terminal:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

### Stopping the application

To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `docker-compose up` is running, and then run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
